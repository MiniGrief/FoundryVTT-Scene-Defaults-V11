# Scene Defaults
![Foundry Core Compatible Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry_Version-11.306-orange)

A module that allows you to change the default settings when creating new scenes. For instance, you can have new scenes created with a grid size of 50 instead of 100 or with Global Illumination turned on, without having to change it each time.

# Installation
As this is simply a fork, I don't plan on submitting it to be included in the main module installer. So you will need to install this from the manifest link below:
> https://github.com/MiniGrief/FoundryVTT-Scene-Defaults-V11/releases/latest/download/module.json

# Usage
Simply click on "Edit Scene Defaults" under "Module Settings", edit the settings to your heart's content, and save it. Any scenes you create will start out with those settings.

# Compatibility
* **Foundry Version**: Scene Defaults is compatible with Foundry VTT V11, and is (probably) safe to use with newer versions as well. (The window for editing scene defaults might get funky, though.)
* **Systems**: Scene Defaults should be compatible with all systems, but won't let you edit scene settings that they might add.
* **Modules**: Scene Defaults shouldn't cause issues with other modules add to scene settings, but won't enable you to change default options for them.
