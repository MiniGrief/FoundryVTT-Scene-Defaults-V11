# Scene Defaults
A module that allows you to change the default settings when creating new scenes.

# Usage
Simply open up the window under "Module Settings", edit the settings to your heart's content, and save it. Any scenes you create will start out with those settings.

# Compatibility
* **Foundry Version**: Scene Defaults is compatible with Foundry VTT 0.6.6 through 0.7.5, and is safe to use with newer versions as well. (The window for editing scene defaults might get funky, though.)
* **Systems**: Scene Defaults should be compatible with all systems, but won't let you edit scene settings that they might add.
* **Modules**: Scene Defaults shouldn't cause issues with other modules add to scene settings, but won't enable you to change default options for them.
